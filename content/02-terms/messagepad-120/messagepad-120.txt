Title: MessagePad 120

----

Text:

The MessagePad 120 shares the same case styling as the [MessagePad 110](/terms/messagepad-110) and [MessagePad 130](/terms/messagepad-130). Improvements over the previous model included a choice of memory configurations, socketed (upgradable) [ROM](/terms/rom), a nonglare screen, an updated operating system, and bundled third-party software.

The code name of the MessagePad 120 was [Gelato](/terms/gelato), due to the fact that it was available in two memory configuration “flavours”. The MessagePad 120 is commonly referred to as an [MP120](/terms/mp120).
