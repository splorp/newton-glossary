Title: Arc

----

Text:

A portion of the circumference of an [oval](/terms/oval) bounded by a pair of radii joining at the oval’s center. Contrast this with a [wedge](/terms/wedge), which includes part of the oval’s interior. Arcs and wedges are defined by the bounding [rectangle](/terms/rectangle) that encloses the oval, along with a pair of angles marking the positions of the bounding radii.
