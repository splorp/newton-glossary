Text:

A book documenting the creation of the Newton. Written by [Markos Kounalakis](http://www.markoskounalakis.com/) and featuring photography by [Doug Menuez](https://menuez.com/). In an ironic nod to the suboptimal [handwriting recognition](/terms/handwriting-recognition) found in the earlier versions of [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os), the spine of the book contains a typo where “Gravity” is spelled “Graviity”.
