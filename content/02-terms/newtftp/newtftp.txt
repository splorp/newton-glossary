A standalone FTP client for [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) developed by [Tactile Systems](/sources/tactile). NewtFTP allowed the user to transfer [packages](/terms/package), [Name File](/terms/name-file) cards, and other types of data between a Newton device and an FTP server. Packages residing on a server could be installed directly onto the Newton. Likewise, text files residing on a server could be converted into [Notepad](/terms/notepad) or [Newton Works](/terms/newton-works) documents.
