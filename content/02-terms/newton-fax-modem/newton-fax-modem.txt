A lightweight, portable modem designed for use with early Newton devices. Released by Apple in 1993, the Newton Fax Modem could be powered by a pair of AA batteries or a power adapter. Nicknamed the [cigarette pack](/terms/cigarette-pack) because its dimensions were similar to that of a package of cigarettes, it was also the unlikely star of the infamous [Modeminos](/terms/modeminos) video.
