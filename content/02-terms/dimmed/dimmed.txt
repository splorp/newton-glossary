Title: Dimmed

----

Text:

Describes words, objects, or other elements of the [user interface](/terms/user-interface) that appear gray or dimmer than the rest of the interface. In a Newton [application](/terms/application), text or objects (such as [buttons](/terms/button)) that are disabled or inactive are generally hidden rather than dimmed.
