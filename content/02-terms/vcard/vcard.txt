Text:

A standardized data format for electronic business cards. Information is typically contained in a file denoted by the [.vcf](/terms/vcf) extension, which can be exchanged via email, instant messaging, or other file transfer mechanism. A vCard that has been transferred to a Newton device can be converted into a [Name File](/terms/name-file) record using an [application](/terms/application) such as [SimpleMail](/terms/simplemail) or [NewtDump](/terms/newtdump).
