Title: Data Form

----

Text:

A symbol that describes the transformations that must occur when data is exchanged with other environments. When you send data or set [endpoint](/terms/endpoint) options, the data form defines how to convert the data from its [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript) format. When you receive data or get endpoint options, the data form defines the type of data expected.
