Desktop Connection Library

A multi-platform communication framework created by [Paul Guyot](/sources/paul-guyot), [Nicolas Zinovieff](https://github.com/krugazor), and [Michael Vacík](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mvacik). DCL was designed to replace the various code libraries and [applications](/terms/application) developed by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) for connecting to and interacting with data stored on devices running [Newton OS](/terms/newton-os) 2.0 and later via the built-in [dock](/terms/dock) protocol. Connections are usually performed via serial cable, but higher level [protocol](/terms/protocol) layers can also run over other connection methods such as [TCP/IP](/terms/tcp-ip).
