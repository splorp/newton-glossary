Title: Jaggies

----

Text:

A condition affecting the [display area](/terms/display-area) of a Newton, where objects and text on the [screen](/terms/screen) are excessively jaggy or irregular. This is related to the position of the [pen](/terms/pen) being misinterpreted. One theory suggests that jaggies may be caused by either an electro-mechanical problem between the [screen](/terms/screen) and the connector or dirt between the display surface and the surrounding bezel.
