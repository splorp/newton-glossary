The _Apple Online Museum_ was founded in 1998 by Lukas Foljanty, originally created as a “result of reading Owen Linzmayer’s _The Mac Bathroom Reader_”. The concept of the site was to to combine the history of [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) products with specifications and other related background information. The site was also known as simply _The Apple Museum_ in later iterations.

Not to be confused with Andy Mesa’s similarly named [The Apple Museum](/sources/apple-museum).
