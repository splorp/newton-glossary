A website founded in 1997 by [Jack Miller](http://jack-miller.org/) that focused on providing humourous takes on various [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) news and rumours. In Miller’s own words, _“We engaged in rampant guesswork, wild speculation, and pure fabrication for the entertainment of our viewers.”_

Appropriately, Miller is now a [live-streaming magician](https://www.twitch.tv/infoxczar).
