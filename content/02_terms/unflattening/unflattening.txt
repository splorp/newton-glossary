In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), the process of converting a stream of bytes from a soup (link: /terms/entry text: entry) into a frame (link: /terms/object text: object). An example of this conversion occurs when installing a (link: /terms/package text: package) on a Newton device. The reverse of this process is (link: /terms/flattening text: flattening).

Colloquially known as (link: /terms/unflattenation text: unflattenation).
