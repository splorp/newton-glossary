Text:

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), a (link: /terms/frame text: frame) that has been converted into a (link: /terms/binary-object text: binary object) using a (link: /terms/translation-engine text: translation engine) when writing the data to a (link: /terms/soup text: soup).

While writing a NewtonScript frame to a soup, the frame is flattened into a binary object, similar to the process used in the Translate global function.
