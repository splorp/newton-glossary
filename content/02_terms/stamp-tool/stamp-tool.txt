A stamp is placed into the document by selecting a stamp with the (link: /terms/pen text: pen) and then tapping somewhere in the document, placing the selcted stamp.

Tapping on the stamp image will cause a (link: /terms/selection-box text: selection box) to to appear around the object, allowing the user to resize the stamp using the (link: /terms/handle text: handles).
