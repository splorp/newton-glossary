Text:

A [dictionary](/terms/dictionary) that allows the user to define words and phrases that are automatically substituted for abbreviations. Along with providing common substitutions, the expand dictionary can be used to correct recurring [handwriting recognition](/terms/handwriting-recognition) mistakes, since each word to be expanded is added to both the [user dictionary](/terms/user-dictionary) and the expand dictionary.

Also referred to as the [Autoexpansion Dictionary](/terms/auto-expansion-dictionary).
