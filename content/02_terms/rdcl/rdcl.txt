Ruby Desktop Connection Library

A Ruby-based communication framework created by (link: /sources/eckhart-koppen text: Eckhart Köppen). Taking a cue from the earlier (link: /terms/dcl text: DCL), RDCL was designed to connect to and interact with data stored on devices running (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) 2.0 and later via the built-in (link: /terms/dock text: dock) protocol. Connections are usually performed via serial cable, but higher level (link: /terms/protocol text: protocol) layers can also run over other connection methods such as [TCP/IP](/terms/tcp-ip).
