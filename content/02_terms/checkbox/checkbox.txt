Text:

A standard (link: /terms/user-interface text: user interface) control that displays a setting, either checked (on) or unchecked (off). (link: /terms/tapping text: Tapping) a checkbox or its text label reverses its setting. When grouped together, one or more checkboxes can be checked at the same time. Compare this to a (link: /terms/radio-button text: radio button) group, where only one button can be (link: /terms/select text: selected) at a time.
