Software developed by (link: /sources/paul-guyot text: Paul Guyot) that replicates functionality found in Apple’s (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilities) (NCU) for computers running the Mac OS X.

Functionality includes (link: /terms/synchronize text: synchronizing) information between a Newton device and the Address Book application, installing (link: /terms/package text: packages), and using a physical keyboard as an (link: /terms/input text: input) peripheral.

Rather than relying on the code found in the (link: /terms/desktop-integration-libraries text: Desktop Integration Libraries) provided by [Apple](https://www.apple.com/), Escale utilizes the Desktop Connection Library ((link: /terms/dcl text: DCL)), allowing native integration of the Newton (link: /terms/docking text: docking) protocol over (link: /terms/tcp-ip text: TCP/IP) as well as serial and (link: /terms/appletalk text: AppleTalk) connections.
