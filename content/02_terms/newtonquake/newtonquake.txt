A rather elaborate and detailed April Fool’s joke perpetrated on the Newton community in 1998. NewtonQuake consisted of a (link: /terms/package text: package) that supposedly ran on a Newton device allowing the user to “play” the infamous [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)) video game. It also came with a Windows application that allegedly could convert Quake .pak archives into Newton packages.

In reality, the NewtonQuake package was nothing more than a large file containing mostly random blocks of characters and could not actually be installed on a Newton device.

Notably, two clear phrases appear within the content of the file.

_“Newton Quake by Ravenous and KrystalMeph”_ and _“April Fools!”_

Also referred to as (link: /terms/newtquake text: NewtQuake).
