The software component included in Apple’s (link: /terms/newton-connection-kit text: Newton Connection Kit) which connects Newton devices to Mac OS and Windows computers, allowing users to exchange and (link: /terms/synchronize text: synchronize) information with common desktop (link: /terms/application text: applications).

Newton Connection for Mac OS X is an application developed by (link: /sources/simon-bell text: Simon Bell) that essentially duplicates the functionality found in Apple’s (link: /terms/newton-connection-utilities text: Newton Connection Utilities) (NCU) for modern Mac OS (link: /terms/operating-system text: operating systems).

Also known as (link: /terms/ncx text: NCX), it allows the user to (link: /terms/backup text: backup) and (link: /terms/restore text: restore) information, install (link: /terms/package text: packages), and transfer data to and from a Newton device.

Backup files created by NCX are identified by the (link: /terms/nbku text: .nbku) filename extension.
