In [NewtonScript](/terms/newtonscript), an endpoint is also [object](/terms/object) created from `protoBasicEndpoint`, or one of its derivative [protos](/terms/proto), that controls a real-time communication session. This object encapsulates and maintains the details of the specific connection, and allows you to control the underlying communication tool.
