Text:

Code that translates or converts data from one type to another.

In (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript), the (link: /terms/global text: global) `Translate` (link: /terms/function text: function) can use a specified translation engine to accomplish data translation.

For example, the (link: /terms/flattener text: flattener) translator converts a (link: /terms/frame text: frame) into a (link: /terms/binary-object text: binary object) containing a (link: /terms/flattened-frame text: flattened frame). Likewise, the (link: /terms/unflattener text: unflattener) translator converts a binary object containing a flattened frame back into a frame.

Also referred to as a (link: /terms/data-translator text: Data Translator).
