Text:

Software that translates code written in a high-level programming language and then runs the program associated with the code at the same time.

For example, (link: /terms/newton-toolkit text: Newton Toolkit) compiles (link: /terms/newtonscript text: NewtonScript) into bytecode and (link: /terms/newton-os text: Newton OS) contains a interpreter that translates the bytecode into data the system understands and can run.

In prerelease versions of Newton OS 1.0, a (link: /terms/recognizer text: recognizer) component of the (link: /terms/handwriting-recognition text: handwriting recognition) system is also called an interpreter.
