Text:

A grey rectangle surrounding one or more (link: /terms/select text: selected) objects that have been encircled with a (link: /terms/highlighting-mark text: highlighting mark) or (link: /terms/tapped text: tapped) with a (link: /terms/pen text: pen). A selection box can appear around text, (link: /terms/ink-text text: ink text), (link: /terms/picture text: pictures), (link: /terms/shape text: shapes), or a combination of objects.

The selected (link: /terms/object text: objects) can be moved by (link: /terms/dragging text: dragging) the selection box. Dragging a (link: /terms/handle text: handle) or edge of a selection box around pictures or shapes will stretch, shrink, or distort the object.
